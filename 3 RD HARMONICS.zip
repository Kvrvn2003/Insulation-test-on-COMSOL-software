In this file I have compiled my findings on electrical field distribution on a water droplet coated insulator due to different amount of harmonics in power.
The insulator is standard grooved disc type with single disc to maintain simplicity.
From the electric field distribution we can directly understand what is the electrical stress zones for a disc insulator most commonly used in our power system and accordingly
design it for better performance. 
Harmonics cause mechanical stress, vibrations---when this factors work in resoanant condition the insulator structure faces fatal amount of vibrations
High-frequency components of harmonics can cause corona discharge and partial discharge activity on the surface of the insulators. 
Corona discharge can degrade the surface of the insulators over time, leading to increased leakage current and eventually flashover.
